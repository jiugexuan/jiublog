# 前言 Forward

That a system which completely alters and even overthrows the whole view of things prevailing, not merely in common life, but also in the greater part of the sciences, should encounter, despite the rigorous demonstration of its principles, a continuing opposition even among those in a position to feel or really to discern the force of its arguments, is a circumstance that can be due only to an incapacity for abstracting from the multitude of individual problems, which, on such an altered view, the busy imagination at once conjures up from the whole wealth of experience, so that the judgment is in consequence distracted and disturbed.

一个不仅在日常生活中，而且在大部分科学中，完全改变甚至推翻主导性的万物观的体系，即使其原理得到了严格的证明，但甚至在那些能够感受到或真正辨别其论点的力量的人中间，仍然遇到了持续的反对。这是一种只能归因于无法从众多的个体问题中抽象出来的情况，【即这个系统不能解决单个问题】在这种改变的观点下，忙碌的想象立刻从全部丰富的经验中召唤出来，因此判断结果会被分散和干扰。

We cannot deny the strength of the arguments, nor do we know of anything certain and assured to put in place of the principles; but we are afraid of the supposedly monstrous consequences that are foreseen to follow from them, and despair of resolving all those difficulties which the principles, in their application, must inevitably encounter.

我们不能否认这些论点的力量，也不知道有什么可以确定和确定的东西可以取代这些原理【即这个掀翻万物观的原理】；但我们担心这些原理可能带来的可怕后果，对解决这些原理在实施过程中不可避免遇到的所有困难感到绝望。

Nevertheless one may legitimately demand of anyone who takes any part whatever in philosophical enquiries, that he be capable of this abstraction, and know how to grasp the principles in the highest degree of generality, wherein details disappear entirely, and wherein, if it be only the highest, the solution of all possible prob­lems is assuredly also contained in advance; and it is therefore natural that in first setting up the system, all enquiries descending into detail should be set aside, and only the first thing needful be done, namely to bring the principles into the open, and to put them beyond all doubt.

然而，一个人可以合理地要求任何参与哲学研究的人，他能够进行这种抽象，并知道如何在最高程度的普遍性中把握原理，其中细节完全消失，如果它真的是最高的，所有可能问题的解决方案肯定也预先包含在内；因此，在第一次建立该系统时，所有深入细节的研究都应该放在一边，而只需要做第一件必要的事，即公开原则，并使其毫无疑问。

And by this, indeed, such a system finds the surest touchstone of its truth, that it not only provides a ready solution to problems hitherto insoluble, but actually generates entirely new problems, never before considered, and by a general shattering of received opinion gives rise to a new sort of truth.

通过这一点，这种体系确实找到了其真理的最可靠的试金石，即它不仅为迄今为止无法解决的问题提供了一个现成的解决方案，而且实际上产生了以前从未考虑过的全新的问题，并通过对公认意见的普遍粉碎而产生了一种新的真理。

But this is precisely characteristic of transcendental idealism, that as soon as it is once admitted, it puts us under the necessity of generating knowledge afresh, as it were, of once more putting to the test what has long since passed as established truth, and, assuming that it stands the test, of at least compelling it to emerge therefrom in a wholly novel shape and form.

但这正是先验观念论【超验唯心主义译法，一听就很邪恶不是吗】的特点，因为它一旦被承认，就会使我们不得不重新产生知识，就像它一样，再次检验早已成为既定真理的东西，并且，假设以前的真理经得起检验，这种【先验观念论的】体现至少要迫使它以一种全新的形式和形态出现。

Now the purpose of the present work is simply this, to enlarge transcendental idealism into what it really should be, namely a system of all knowledge. The aim, then, is to provide proof of the system, not merely in general, but in actual fact, that is, through the real extension of its principles to all possible problems in regard to the main objects of knowledge, whether these have already been raised earlier, but not resolved, or have only now been rendered possible and have newly come into existence through the system itself.

现在，这项工作【或者说这本书】的目的只是这样，把先验观念论扩大到它真正应该成为的样子，即所有知识的体系。那么，我们的目的是为这个体系提供证明，不仅仅是在一般情况下，而是在实际情况下【用现实的事实证明】，也就是说，通过把它的原理真正扩展到有关知识的主要对象的所有可能的问题上，不管这些问题是早先已经提出但没有解决的，还是现在才变得可能并通过这个体系本身新出现的。

It follows accordingly that this work must treat of topics and questions that have simply never been agitated or artic­ulated among a great many of those who now presume nonetheless to have an opinion in philosophical matters; inasmuch as they still halt at the first rudiments of the system, and cannot get beyond them, either because of an initial incapacity even to understand what the first principles of all knowledge require, or because of prejudice, or for whatever other reason.

因此，这项工作必须处理那些根本没有在许多现在自以为在哲学事物上有观念的人中间引起过讨论或清楚说明的主题和问题；因为他们仍然停留在这个体系的最初的雏形上，无法超越它们，要么是因为最初甚至没有理解所有知识的最初原理的能力，要么是因为偏见，或者出于任何其他原因。

Now although the enquiry does of course revert to elementary first principles, the above class of persons has little to hope for from the present work, since in regard to basic enqui­ries nothing can be found herein that has not already been said long since, either in the writings of the originator of the Science of Knowl­edge, or in those of the present author; save that in the present treatment, the exposition in regard to certain points may perhaps have achieved a greater clarity than it previously possessed —— though even this can never, at any rate, make up for a fundamental want of understanding.

现在，尽管现在研究当然会回到基本的第一原则，但上述这类人对本著作没有什么希望【谢灵时代的哲学家】，因为在基本研究方面，没有什么东西是在《知识科学》【费希特所著 The Science of Knowledge】的创始人或现在的作者的著作中没有说过的；只是在目前的处理中，对某些问题的阐述可能比以前更清晰了—— 尽管这也不能弥补【他们】基本的理解不足。

The means, furthermore, whereby the author has sought to achieve his aim of setting forth idealism in its full extent, consist in presenting every part of philosophy in a single continuum, and the whole of philosophy as what in fact it is, namely a progressive history of self-consciousness, for which what is laid down in experience serves merely, so to speak, as a memorial and a document. 

此外，作者试图实现其充分阐述【在其全部范围内】观念论【这个词又译作唯心主义】的目的的方法在于，将哲学的每一部分呈现在一个单一的连续体系中，并将整个哲学呈现为事实，即自我意识的进步历史，对于这一历史，经验中所述的东西可以说只是一个纪念和文件。

In order to trace this history with precision and completeness, it was chiefly a matter, not only of separating exactly the individual stages thereof, and within these again the individual moments, but also of presenting them in a sequence, whereby one can be certain, thanks to the very method employed in its discovery, that no necessary intervening step has been omitted; the result being to confer upon the whole an inter­nal coherence which time cannot touch, and which in all subsequent development remains, as it were, the unalterable framework, to which everything must be related.

为了准确和完整地追溯这段历史，主要的问题是，不仅要准确区分其中的各个阶段，以及在这些阶段中的各个时刻，而且要按顺序展示它们，由于在发现过程中采用的方法，人们可以确定没有遗漏任何必要的中间步骤；其结果是赋予整个体系以时间无法侵蚀的内部一致性【即永远是对的】，而且在所有后续发展中，它仍然是不可改变的框架，一切都必须与之相关。

The author’s chief motive for devoting particular care to the depiction of this coherence, which is really a *graduated sequence* of intuitions, whereby the self raises itself to the highest power of consciousness, was the parallelism of nature with intelligence; to this he has long since been led, and to depict it completely, neither transcendental philosophy nor the phi­losophy of nature is adequate by itself; *both sciences* together are alone able to do it, though on that very account the two must forever be opposed to one another, and can never merge into one.

作者特别注意描述这种连贯性的主要动机是自然与智慧的平行性，这种连贯性实际上是直觉的“渐进序列”，自我由此提升到意识【神的】的最高力量；他【即作者】早就被引导到这一点，为了完整地描绘它，无论是先验哲学还是自然哲学本身都是不够的；只有这两种科学集中在一起才能做到这一点，尽管正是因为这个原因，这两种科学必须永远相互对立，永远无法融合为一体。【二者不能相互消解，理性和实证的对立】

The conclusive proof of the perfectly equal reality of the two sciences from a theoretical standpoint, which the author has hitherto merely asserted, is thus to be sought in transcendental phi­losophy, and especially in that presentation of it which is contained in the present work; and the latter must therefore be considered as a nec­essary counterpart to his writings on the philosophy of nature.

因此，在先验哲学中，尤其是在本书中对先验哲学的介绍中，可以找到从理论角度证明这两门科学完全平等的结论性证据，而作者迄今为止只是断言这一点；因此，先验哲学必须被视为其自然哲学著作的必要对应物。

For in this work it will become apparent, that the same powers of intuition which reside in the self can also be exhibited up to a certain point in nature; and, since the boundary in question is itself that of theoretical and practical philosophy, that it is therefore indifferent, from a purely theoretical standpoint, whether objective or subjective be made pri­mary, since this is a matter that practical philosophy (though it has no voice at all in this connection) is alone able to decide; whence it will also appear that even idealism has no purely theoretical basis, and to that extent, if theoretical evidence alone be accepted, can never have the evidential cogency of which natural science is capable, whose basis and proof alike are theoretical through and through. Readers ac­ quainted with the philosophy of nature will, indeed, conclude from these observations, that there is a reason, lying pretty deep in the sub­ ject itself, why the author has opposed this science to transcendental philosophy and completely separated it therefrom, whereas, to be sure, if our whole enterprise were merely that of explaining nature, we should never have been driven into idealism.

因为在这部作品中，很明显，存在于自我中的同样的直觉能力也可以在自然界中展示到一定程度；而且，由于有关的界限本身就是理论哲学和实践哲学的界限，因此，从纯理论的角度来看，不管是把客观的还是主观的作为主要的，都是无所谓的，因为这是实践哲学（尽管它在这方面根本没有发言权）唯一能够决定的事情。由此可见，即使是唯心主义也没有纯粹的理论基础，而且在这个意义上，如果仅仅接受理论证据，也不可能具有自然科学所具有的证据说服力，因为自然科学的基础和证明都是通篇的理论。熟悉自然哲学的读者确实会从这些观察中得出结论，有一个原因，就在这个课题本身的深处，为什么作者把这门科学与超验哲学对立起来，并把它与超验哲学完全分开，而可以肯定的是，如果我们的整个事业仅仅是解释自然，我们就不应该被逼到理想主义。

But now as to the deductions which are effected in the present work from the primary objects of nature, from matter as such and its general functions, from the organism, etc., there are certainly idealis­tic, though not on that account teleological derivations (albeit many re­gard them as equivalent), which are as little capable of giving satisfaction in idealism as in any other system. For supposing I prove, for ex­ample, that it is necessary for the sake of freedom, or for practical pur­ poses, that there should be matter having such and such properties, or that the intellect intuit its dealings with the external world as medi­ated through an organism, this demonstration continues to leave un­answered for me the question as to how and by what mechanism the intellect actually intuits precisely that which is necessary for this pur­pose. On the contrary, all proofs that the idealist offers for the exist­ence of determinate external things must be derived from the primor­ dial mechanism of intuition itself, that is, by a genuine *construction* of objects. Since the proofs are idealistic, the merely teleological applica­ tion of them would not in fact advance true knowledge a single step, since notoriously the teleological explanation of an object can teach me nothing whatever as to its real origin.

------

In a system of transcendental idealism as such, the truths of *practical* philosophy can themselves emerge only as intervening links, and that part of practical philosophy actually pertaining to the system consists only of what is objective therein, and this, in its broadest gen­ erality, is history; a topic that, in a system of idealism, requires to be deduced transcendentally no less than does the objective of first order, namely nature. This deduction of history leads directly to the proof that what we have to regard as the ultimate ground of harmony be­tween the subjective and the objective in action must in fact be con­ceived as an absolute identity; though to think of this latter as a sub­stantial or personal entity would in no way be better than to posit it in a pure abstraction —— an opinion that could be imputed to idealism only through the grossest of misunderstandings.

------

So far as concerns the basic principles of *teleology*, the reader will doubtless recognize for himself that they point to the only way of explaining the coexistence of mechanism with purposiveness in nature in an intelligible manner. ——And finally, with reference to the precepts concerning *the philosophy of art*, whereby the whole is concluded, the author begs those who may have some special interest in this subject to remember that the whole enquiry, which considered in itself is an infinite one, is here instituted merely in regard to the system of phi­losophy, whereby a multitude of aspects of this immense topic has had to be excluded from consideration in advance.

------

The author observes in conclusion that one of his subsidiary aims has been to provide an account of transcendental idealism that shall be, so far as possible, generally readable and intelligible; and that the possibility of some success in this, in virtue of the very method that he has chosen, is something of which he is already con­vinced by a twofold experience in publicly presenting the system.

------

This brief foreword will be sufficient, nonetheless, to arouse some interest in the book among those who share the author’s stand­ point and seek with him a solution of the same problems, and to at­tract those who wish for information and instruction; while those who are neither acquainted with the one, nor genuinely desirous of the other, will be scared away from it at the outset; and all its objects will be thereby achieved.
